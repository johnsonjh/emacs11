I have posted a minimal EMACS-11 distribution to net.sources since
I got several dozen replies to my offer to dig it out of my archives.

It is about four times larger than any previous posting I have seen
in net.sources, so I was kind of hesitant about sticking it all
in one posting like that.  I'm sure that other new netter's besides
myself could use a little guidance as to what volume is acceptable
for electronic distribution and when tape-only distributions should
be used instead.

Anyway, I hope everyone that requested a copy finds it useful!
